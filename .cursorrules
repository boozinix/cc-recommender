# Canon Rules for cc-recommender Project

## 🛡️ Safety First - Always Reversible

**CRITICAL**: The user has zero coding knowledge and relies entirely on AI assistance. Every change must be:
1. **Reversible** - Always commit changes before making modifications
2. **Explainable** - Explain what you're doing in simple, non-technical terms
3. **Testable** - Verify changes work before considering them complete
4. **Backed up** - Use git commits as checkpoints

## 📋 Git Workflow - Safety Net

### Before Making ANY Changes:
1. **Check current status**: `git status` to see what's changed
2. **Commit existing work**: If there are uncommitted changes, commit them first with a clear message
3. **Create a branch** (optional but recommended): `git checkout -b feature/description` for major changes
4. **Make changes incrementally**: Small, testable changes are safer than large refactors

### After Making Changes:
1. **Test the changes**: Run the app and verify it works (`npm run dev`)
2. **Review what changed**: `git diff` to see exactly what was modified
3. **Commit with clear messages**: Use descriptive commit messages like "Add feature X" or "Fix bug Y"
4. **Explain to user**: Tell them what changed and why, in simple terms

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- **Revert immediately**: `git restore <file>` to undo changes to a file
- **Or reset to last commit**: `git reset --hard HEAD` (use with caution - explains risks first)
- **Or checkout previous commit**: `git checkout <commit-hash>` to go back in time

## 🎯 Communication Guidelines

### When Talking to the User:
- **No jargon**: Avoid technical terms without explanation
- **Use analogies**: Compare coding concepts to everyday things
- **Show, don't just tell**: When possible, show what changed visually
- **Ask before major changes**: For significant refactors, explain the plan first
- **Explain the "why"**: Don't just say what you're doing, explain why it helps

### Example Good Explanations:
- ❌ "I'm refactoring the component to use hooks"
- ✅ "I'm updating the code to make it easier to maintain and fix bugs. Think of it like reorganizing a filing cabinet - same stuff, but easier to find things later."

## 🔧 Code Standards

### TypeScript/React Best Practices:
- Use TypeScript types properly - catch errors before they happen
- Keep components focused - one component, one job
- Use meaningful variable names - `userAnswers` not `data`
- Add comments for complex logic - explain the "why" not the "what"
- Handle errors gracefully - never let the app crash silently

### File Organization:
- Keep related code together
- Don't create unnecessary files
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- When in doubt, ask the user or explain your approach

## 🚨 Red Flags - Stop and Ask

**STOP and explain before:**
- Deleting files (unless explicitly requested)
- Changing file structure significantly
- Updating dependencies/package.json
- Modifying git history
- Making breaking changes to existing features
- Adding new dependencies

## 📝 Change Documentation

When making changes:
1. **What**: What did you change?
2. **Why**: Why was this change needed?
3. **How to test**: How can the user verify it works?
4. **How to revert**: What command to undo if needed?

## 🎓 Teaching Moments

When appropriate, explain:
- What the code does in simple terms
- Why we're doing it this way
- What could go wrong and how we prevent it
- How to recognize similar patterns in the future

## 🔄 Revert Strategy

Always provide a clear revert path:
- For single file: `git restore app/wizard/page.tsx`
- For all changes: `git reset --hard HEAD`
- For specific commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
- Show git log: `git log --oneline` to find commit to revert to

**Remember**: The user trusts you completely. Earn that trust by being careful, clear, and always providing a way back.
